# To-Do List App

The To-Do List App is a simple application that helps you to keep track of your daily todos. You can easily add new items, edit these items or check them off when finished. You can even mark all items as finished in one go by clicking one button. 

The To-Do List App has three views: one containing all todo items, one that shows only the active items and one that shows the completed items. 

Every todo can be deleted by clicking the 'x' on the right of it. Additionally, whenever todos are completed, the button 'Clear completed' appears, which will delete the completed items off the list.

All todos are stored locally on the user's disk and remain there until the user either deletes them via the application or manually within the browsers settings. 

This application is written with pure JavaScript, but can be enhanced by implementing a library.
